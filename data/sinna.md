# Zomi Language Integration Project

Welcome to the **Zomi Language Integration Project**, an initiative aimed at facilitating the inclusion of the Zomi language in Google Translate and other language technology platforms.

## Project Goals

1. **Google Translate Integration**: Advocate for Zomi's addition to Google Translate
2. **Interim Translation Tool**: Build a Zomi translation prototype
3. **Dataset Creation**: Develop comprehensive Zomi-English language resources
4. **Community Engagement**: Enable Zomi speakers to contribute
